## What makes a Pokemon Legendary?

## Introduction

A data science project where I play the role of Professor Oak's researcher, I investigate the characteristics of legendary Pokémon to understand what makes them unique.

## Main

From browsing 800+ Pokémon, we can see that the stats are what makes a Pokémon a legendary or at least a pseudo legendary. Using count() from the dplyr package we can see  how many out of the Pokédex are actually legendary. (70/800)



Looking at the relationship between the height and weight of the Pokemon, I also added a conditional label that'll only print the Pokmeon's name if it's heavier than 600kg (Approx. 1322 lbs) or taller than 7.5m (24 ft).
